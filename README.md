🔍 Machine Learning Classification Project

In this repository, you can find Python scripts for a machine learning project aimed at classifying smoking and drinking status using various machine learning techniques.

📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers and drinkers or non-drinkers based on demographic, medicine and behavioral data.

🔬 Model Selection and Evaluation

Two machine learning models were explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in classifying smoking and drinking habits:

1. Random Forest Classifier for Smoking classification: Chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and robustness to outliers. The Random Forest model was trained and optimized to predict smoking status, resulting in improved precision and stability in predictions.

2. Random Forest Classifier for Alcoholism classification: Chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and robustness to outliers. The Random Forest model was trained and optimized to predict alcoholism status, resulting in improved precision and stability in predictions.

🛠️ Code Structure

The repository contains a unique script which contains:

- Data preprocessing.
- Training machine learning models.
- Application of SMOTE technique.
- Application of InterQuartile Range (IQR).
- Application of Grid Search method for hyperparameter optimization.
- Evaluating model performance.

📊 Data Analysis and Visualization

Data analysis and visualization were performed to gain insights into the dataset and assess the performance of the machine learning models. 
Visualizations include distribution plots of demographic variables, confusion matrices and classification metrics, such as precision, recall and accuracy.

🗂️ Repository Structure
Due to the large size of the dataset, it was not feasible to include it directly in the repository. 
However, you can access the dataset used for training the model at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset

📚 Documentation

A comprehensive documentation file is available in Italian, providing detailed explanations of the selected machine learning models, data preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics. The documentation also includes charts and graphs generated from the evaluation results.
